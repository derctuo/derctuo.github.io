<p>apparently these good people solved the explosion in steps when the
ray gets close to the surface during SDF sphere marching (thanks to
@Atrix256 ) <a href="https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.1111/cgf13951">https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.1111/cgf13951</a></p>
<p>i must say i'm a little angry with myself because i spent hundreds
of hours on getting around this exact problem and couldn't find a
better way.</p>
<p>there's only two shadertoys yet <a href="https://shadertoy.com/view/WdKczW">https://shadertoy.com/view/WdKczW</a></p>
<p>the classical sphere marching method: lipschitz continuity
guarantees that the blue line never intersects the diagonal of the
red stepping function, which always moves as many units forward as
it has measured upwards.</p>
<p>plotting the first derivative of our curve (green), the light green
lines designate the global lipschitz limit that the function is
guaranteed never to overstep.</p>
<p>the purple lines bracket the local upper and lower bounds of the
first derivative within a local region.</p>
<p>plotting the limits as as a wedge of tangents, all positive, we see
that the region can't possibly contain a root, and thus deem it safe
to skip the entire interval.</p>
<p>whereas in this less beneficial interval, our tangent bundle can
only guarantee us safe passage up until the cyan colored point.</p>
<p>this region here however allows us to make a step twice as a large
as a simple SDF lookup would permit us.</p>
<p>it is easy to see how this method becomes particularly useful when
we are grazing surfaces with low curvature, as the tangent width
narrows, and we can practically perform an interation of the
newton-raphson method.</p>
<p>the authors don't do a good job of showing these connections. the
provided formula is effectively a version of the newton-raphson
method which uses a gradient interval instead of a local gradient.</p>
<p>to compute the gradient interval, you use a combination of automatic
differentiation and interval arithmetic on the first derivative.
here are primitives for both:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interval Arithmetic <a href="https://shadertoy.com/view/lssSWH">https://shadertoy.com/view/lssSWH</a></li>
<li>Derivative Arithmetic <a href="https://shadertoy.com/view/4dVGzw">https://shadertoy.com/view/4dVGzw</a></li>
</ul>
<p>the new arithmetic primitives will likely look a lot like joint
ranges from revised affine arithmetic
(<a href="https://shadertoy.com/view/4sV3zm">https://shadertoy.com/view/4sV3zm</a>), except that we get a right
facing interval cone instead.</p>
<p>a much more important consequence of all this is that the lipschitz
continuity requirement |f'(x)| &lt;= 1 no longer applies as we always
see a local gradient cone. you can use this to trace any old
implicit function, not just only distance functions.</p>
<p>bonus: with 1 more sample at the right end of the interval, we can
reuse the same gradient interval, flip it, and use it to truncate
our extrapolated destination. in this case, we discover that we can
skip the entire interval rather than having to jump to the cyan
point.</p>
<p>the right hand samples amortize over time, as we can reuse them in
the next iteration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dumb question: if you can do interval arithmetic on your function,
why not directly check the interval result in the target segment (to
see if it contains 0), rather than the interval of the gradient in
the segment?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>what do you do when the interval contains a possible root?</p>
<p>Ah, that explains why this is useful :D</p>
<p>I agree that affine arithmetic could tell you how far you could
safely walk; I'm curious to see how "point + gradient range" (this
paper) compares to "affine region" (RAA), in terms of ease of
computation / tightness of bounds / etc.</p>

<p>@paniq:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RAA is costly, and has overshoots i.e. false positives, which means
you're frequently backtracking. building intervals on the first
derivative should in many cases be cheaper.</p>
