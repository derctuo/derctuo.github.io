<p>I've seen the kingdoms blow like ashes in the winds of change, yeah,
but the power of truth is the fuel for the flame.  So the darker the
ages get, there's a stronger beacon yet. ... If the world is
night — shine my life like a light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Indigo Girls, "Let It Be Me"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When your vision stays clear in the face of your fear; when you see
turning out the lights, which is their only power, when we stand
like spotlights in a mighty tower — all for one and one for all!
Then we sing the common call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— (same)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything that we call Invention, discovery in the higher sense, is
the ultimate outcome of the original perception of some truth,
which, long perfected in quiet, leads at length suddenly to and
unexpectedly to productive recognition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Goethe, quoted by Reuleaux in the introduction to Kinematics of
Machinery, as translated by Alexander Blackie William Kennedy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Help, I'm a rock!  Somebody!  Please!  Help, I'm a rock!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— The Mothers of Invention</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you so much for your warm hospitality this evening.  We are so
grateful to play for you.  Thank you so much, friends; we are so
privileged to be able to gather in moments like this when so much of
the world is plunged in darkness and chaos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Leonard Cohen, at a concert in London 2008, before playing <em>Anthem</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't dwell on what has passed away. ... Ring the bells that still
can ring; forget your perfect offering.  There is a crack in
everything.  That's how the light gets in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Leonard Cohen, <em>Anthem</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Staring at the blank page before you, open up the dirty window, let
the sun illuminate the words that you could not find; reaching, so
close you can almost taste it — release your inhibitions!  Feel the
rain on your skin; no one else can feel it for you, only you can let
it in.  No one else, no one else can speak the words on your lips.
Drench yourself in words unspoken, live your life with arms wide
open; today is where your book begins.  The rest is still unwritten!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Natasha Bedingfield, <em>Unwritten</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wandering Star, for whom it is reserved the blackness, the darkness,
forever. ...  And the masks that the monsters wear to feed upon
their prey.  ... Always doubled up inside, taunted, cruel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Portishead, <em>Wandering Star</em></p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/art.html">Art</a> (3 notes)
