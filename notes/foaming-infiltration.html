(1 minute)</div><p>Infiltration of a porous object is a common and very useful technique
for strengthening, waterproofing, or otherwise altering shapes
fabricated initially by a process that inherently produces a porous
green body or other shape.</p>
<p>One difficulty is that you can't infiltrate with solids; the
infiltrant needs to be liquid.  In some cases it would be possible to
infiltrate with a colloid or suspension, but once the solvent is
removed, the shape becomes porous again.</p>
<p>Various ways of causing solid grains of material to expand into a foam
are known: shooting rice out of steam cannons, heating waterglass (or
vermiculite or perlite) to drive out the water, baking muffins to
react their baking powder, and so on.  If such processes are
applicable to the infiltrant grains and produce a closed-cell foam,
they can seal up the porosity.</p>
<p>Construction spray foam illustrates another approach to foaming via
heating: the polymerization reaction of the foam produces heat which
produces the foaming gas.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/materials.html">Materials</a> (51 notes)
