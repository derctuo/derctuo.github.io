(1 minute)</div><p>In <a href="cold-plasma.html">my note on cold plasma</a> I wrote about the
possibilities of using cold plasma to slowly reduce metal, dissolve
away epoxy, and so on.  But it's also very useful to be able to
<em>oxidize</em> metal, especially iron, for example to cut it.  And, as I
found there, hydrogen can reduce iron from FeO at almost any
temperature as long as there's about 10× as much hydrogen as steam.
But that <em>also</em> means that <em>steam</em> can <em>oxidize</em> iron to FeO at almost
any temperature <em>until</em> 90% of the steam has been reduced by the iron.</p>
<p>This suggests the use of steam as a substitute for oxygen in an
oxy-acetylene cutting torch.</p>
<p>That's probably a dumb idea because probably you lose more than 79% of
the heat of oxidizing the iron to splitting up the water.  FeO's
melting point is 1377°, its enthalpy of formation is XXX ????, and
water's enthalpy of formation is -285 kJ/mol.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/materials.html">Materials</a> (51 notes)
