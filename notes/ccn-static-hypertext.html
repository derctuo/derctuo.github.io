(2 minutes)</div><p>Implementing a static hypertext system on top of a service like the
retrieve-by-hash service described in <a href="../notes/ccn-streams.html">Feeds or streams on CCNs</a> is
straightforward.</p>
<h2>Static hypertext</h2>
<p>Each hypertext page is a file stored in the system, consisting of a
short metadata header followed by the page itself in a format such as
HTML or PDF, and it is identified by its hash.  Links to another page
include the hash <code>H</code> of the file it’s stored in.  In this way, you can
be certain that the linked page is precisely the version of the page
that the author intended; no attacker can redirect you to a different
page, not even the author herself at a later date, perhaps while being
tortured by Mossad agents.</p>
<p>Of course, if the attacker can trick you into looking at a page of
theirs instead, they can make a copy of an authentic page with all the
links redirected to more pages they wrote.  So all the security comes
from the security of the initial link.</p>
<p>This secure linking mechanism is also applicable to things like
stylesheets, image liabilities, software libraries, software
configuration files, and text transclusions.  In combination with a
deterministic archival virtual machine with immutable semantics, this
guarantees the interpretability of XXX</p>
<p>A single file can easily contain multiple different “pages”, as
TiddlyWiki does; the fragment-identifier mechanism of the XXX</p>
