(6 minutes)</div><p>ISO C99, and GCC since earlier, support <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Compound-Literals.html">so-called compound
literals</a>.  I’ve written a number of C functions that look more or
less like this:</p>
<pre><code>static struct point point_at(int x, int y)
{
    struct point p = {.x = x, .y = y};
    return p;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The compound literal syntax allows you to write this more simply:</p>
<pre><code>static struct point point_at(int x, int y)
{
    return (struct point){.x = x, .y = y};
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, in simple cases like this, it often eliminates the need for
the function altogether, if it existed only for brevity; you can just
say <code>typedef struct point point; ... mp = (point){3, 4};</code> rather than
<code>mp = point_at(3, 4);</code>.</p>
<p>This is of course even more useful for arguments of functions;
consider:</p>
<pre><code>static point delta(point a, point b)
{
    return (point) {.x = a.x - b.x, .y = a.y - b.y};
}

static int distsq(point a, point b)
{
    point d = delta(a, b);
    return d.x*d.x + d.y*d.y;
}

...
printf("%d\n", distsq((point){2, -1}, (point){5, 3}));
</code></pre>
<p>It’s a shame that C doesn’t have top-down type inference for this
context, so we can’t write <code>distsq({2, -1}, {5, 3})</code> and have the
compiler infer the <code>point</code> type.  Even OCaml fails us here — because
its type inference is bottom-up, to infer types in such cases it
requires the field names of record types to be unique, like 1970s C,
rather than scoping them within a single record type: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8928970/two-fields-of-two-records-have-same-label-in-ocaml">as SoftTimur
pointed out on Stack Overflow, this is an error in OCaml</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>type name =
    { r0: int; r1: int; c0: int; c1: int;
      typ: dtype;
      uid: uid (* key *) }

and func =
    { name: string;
      typ: dtype;
      params: var list;
      body: block }
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/old_caml_site/FAQ/FAQ_EXPERT-eng.html#labels_surcharge">in the OCaml FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>(There’s an interesting niche open for a language that uses structural
subtyping like OCaml’s object types and polymorphic variants, but for
records with an open set of field names — the kind of thing people do
in JS or Lua or with JSON, but with static type checking.  I think
OCaml didn’t have subtyping at all at the time records were added, and
its use is still controversial.)</p>
<p>Getting back to C, one of the more interesting uses for <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Designated-Inits.html#Designated-Inits">so-called
designated initializers for struct fields</a> (<code>.x =</code>...) is
<em>optional values</em>.  If you have a struct initializer with any
initialized fields in it, then <em>all</em> the fields of the struct are
initialized — even if its storage class is <code>auto</code>, the unspecified
ones are initialized to 0, as in Java or Golang!  So regardless of how
many fields are in a <code>struct foo</code> you can initialize them <em>all</em> to 0
by saying something like:</p>
<pre><code>struct foo x = {0};
</code></pre>
<p>(I think this may be illegal in some versions of C if the first member
of <code>struct foo</code> is some kind of aggregate, and I think it applies to
arrays as well, and I think the requirement to have at least one
initialized field has been removed in recent versions of C so <code>struct
foo x = {};</code> works too, but I’m not sure of any of those.)</p>
<p>So if you have a struct with a large number of fields, you can specify
that you want to initialize one or two of them:</p>
<pre><code>struct image_transforms t = { .premultiply_alpha = TRUE, .max_depth = 8 };
</code></pre>
<p>This kind of thing is especially useful to give named arguments to
functions with a large number of optional arguments; maybe somewhere
there’s a <code>transform_image(&amp;t, ...);</code> function you’re going to invoke.
Of course, you always could have designed the interface with a bunch
of functions:</p>
<pre><code>image_transform_p t = new_image_transform();
if (!t) return 0;
it_set_premultiply_alpha(t, TRUE);
it_set_max_depth(t, 8);
</code></pre>
<p>But this has several drawbacks compared to the designated-initializer
approach.  It’s more code.  It introduces runtime failure into what
could have been statically allocated memory, or
statically-space-verified stack-allocated memory.  It takes time at
runtime to execute the function calls, although initializing
stack-allocated memory also takes time at runtime.  For
statically-allocated objects, you need to somehow run the
initialization code at startup, before anything uses the object.  It
can’t be used inside an expression — it forces the caller into an
imperative style.  And the implementor of the calling interface must
write or macro-expand a large number of setter functions.</p>
<p>With compound literals with designated initializers, you get a sort of
verbose named-argument syntax:</p>
<pre><code>transform_image(&amp;(struct image_transforms){
    .premultiply_alpha = TRUE, .max_depth = 8});
</code></pre>
<p>This is not a terribly efficient way to get named arguments, though;
since this struct has automatic storage duration, if you have 48
fields in the struct, the compiler has to emit code to initialize the
other 46, too.</p>
<p>The astonishing thing, though, is that in C, all of these compound
literals with automatic storage duration last to the end of their
enclosing scope, while in C++ they’re treated as temporaries and
disappear rather quickly.  This means you can build up arbitrarily
complex nested structures this way, like Lisp.  Consider this
expression of the S combinator in the λ calculus:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct ulc
{
    const char *var;
    struct ulc *rator, *rand, *body;
} ulc;

...
ulc s = { "x", .body = &amp;(ulc) {
        "y", .body = &amp;(ulc) {
            "z", .body = &amp;(ulc) {
                .rator = &amp;(ulc) {
                    .rator = &amp;(ulc) { "x" }, .rand = &amp;(ulc) { "z" }},
                .rand = &amp;(ulc) {
                    .rator = &amp;(ulc) { "y" }, .rand = &amp;(ulc) { "z" }}}}}};
</code></pre>
<p>Here a λ-abstraction is represented by an <code>ulc</code> having a non-null
<code>body</code> and a non-null <code>var</code>, a variable is represented by having a
null <code>body</code> and a non-null <code>var</code>, and an application of an operator to
an operand is represented by having a null <code>var</code>.</p>
<p>This represents some kind of argument about the merits of these
language features but I am not sure whether it is in favor or in
opposition.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (13 notes)
