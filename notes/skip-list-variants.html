(4 minutes)</div><p>Skip lists are generalized sorted linked lists that incorporate
logarithmic-time insertion, deletion, and search.  In their normal
form, the link pointers point in only one direction, let's say
forward.  The generalization is that each node has a "height", a
positive integer chosen randomly from an exponential distribution,
which tells <em>how many pointers</em> it will contain.  The height-1
pointers are the usual linked-list pointers, but the other pointers
skip nodes; a height-P pointer, instead of pointing to the next node,
points to the next node <em>of height P or greater</em>.</p>
<p>Skip lists are transposed, randomized B-trees.  You take a B-tree,
replace all of its adjacency relationships within B-tree nodes with a
previous or next pointer — turning the node into a doubly-linked
list — and then replace all child pointers with new adjacency
relationships.  (You can treat the child pointers as going to the
first piece of the split-up child node, or the last — it doesn't
matter, as long as the other pieces are reachable from it.)  Now you
have a skip list, but an unorthodox one, with fairly regular spacing
between nodes of the same height.</p>
<p>The B-tree invariant that each node has between N and M keys
translates into a new invariant in these lists: if you can reach a
previous node by following a single pointer at height P, then it will
take between N and M hops by following a single pointer at height P -
1.</p>
<p>You can do the usual operations of insertion and deletion, including
appending, on such a list without violating its invariants.  Whenever
you create a node containing a pointer at height P - 1, you must check
to see how many nodes surround it that do not contain a pointer at
height P.  If there aren't enough, you need to extend the node to
height P, then repeat the process.</p>
<p>(It is by no means clear that this is superior to the standard
approach of picking a random height for each new node, but it gives a
one-to-one mapping to B-trees maintaining their usual invariants.
Clearly you can use the skip-list random-level approach with the
B-tree layout as well.)</p>
<p>A somewhat inconvenient aspect of the standard skip-list
implementation is that the nodes are many different sizes, which is
more difficult for dynamic memory allocation (and some type systems)
to handle.  It's reasonable to ask if there's a way to avoid this.</p>
<p>If the distribution of heights is 50% 1, 25% 2, 12½% 3, and so on,
then the mean height will be 2.  You could maybe provide 2 link fields
per node, which sounds like... a binary search tree!</p>
<p>So here's an idea.  What if you assign heights as before, but only
have two pointers per node: one to the immediately next node, the
other to the next node <em>of a larger height than the immediately next
node</em>?  (I also thought of "of a larger height than the current node,"
and "preceding a node of a larger height than the immediately next
node" and such things.)  This ought to permit rapid traversal in
essentially the same manner as an ordinary skip list.</p>
<p>XXX try it</p>
<p>Clearly you can also just sort of bulldoze the pointers of an ordinary
skip list across the following nodes, so a node of height 4 will have
a heigh-4 pointer, then be followed with a node with a height-3
pointer, then one with a height-2 pointer, and then if either of those
nodes had a height of more than 1 themselves, then the corresponding
pointer will be pushed onto the next node.  The difficulty with this
variant is that insertion and deletion is no longer cheap.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/algorithms.html">Algorithms</a> (17 notes)
