(10 minutes)</div><p>A possible ambition for Derctuo is to include all the background
information needed to understand it, if I can find freely-licensed
sources.  So, for example, <a href="pandemic-collapse.html">Pandemic Collapse</a> talks about
geography (the US, Tenochtitlán, Cambodia), historical events (the
Vietnam War, the 1918 flu, the Bronze Age Collapse), economic concepts
(unemployment, insurance, banks), and other institutions (the US DoD,
the Mormon church, major corporations).  <a href="solar-furnace-cpc.html">Solar furnace CPC</a>
talks about physical properties of common materials, the
Stefan–Boltzmann law, manufacturing processes of ceramics,
thermodynamics, units of measurement, basic optics, and the structure
of the solar system.  <a href="ccn-streams.html">CCN Streams</a> talks about networked
systems architecture, hashing, SHA-256, TCP/IP, disks, telephone
networks, and all kinds of programming stuff.</p>
<p>What is the body of knowledge that would be needed to make sense of
all this stuff?  Consider the Stefan–Boltzmann law.  To make any sense
of the statement <em>j</em> = <em>σT</em>⁴ you need to know algebraic notation and
what energy and temperature are, including the concept of absolute
temperature.  And you need to understand how solid objects have
surface areas.</p>
<p>Geographic and historical knowledge in particular is sort of endless.
Tenochtitlán is Mexico City today, with 8.8 million people, 0.11% of
the world’s population; Mexico City’s Wikipedia page is 213kB, 33000
words; the destruction of Tenochtitlán (what is referenced in
Pandemic Collapse) is mentioned briefly after 9% of the page.  If
you divided the world into, say, 2048 regions of equal population (4
million or so), and included 4096 words or so on each of these
regions, you’d probably cover most of the geographic facts of
importance comparable to the ruin of Tenochtitlán, in about 8.3
million words, about 30,000 pages; you could read it all, once, in
three to six months.</p>
<h2>Vital Articles</h2>
<p>Wikipedia’s “Vital Articles” constitutes an attempt to codify such a
general-purpose body of knowledge.  There are ten Level 1 Vital
Articles, including “Human History” (21000 words, 137kB, mentions
Mexico and the Aztecs, and has a couple of sentences on the European
conquest of the Americas); 100 Level 2 Vital Articles, including 10
articles on history (the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_period">early modern period</a>” article has a
couple of sentences on the European conquest out of 18000 words and
120kB and mentions the Aztecs, and so does “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization">civilization</a>”) and 11
on geography (the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America">North America</a>” article’s 18000 words in 123kB
does explain, “The Mayan culture was still present in southern Mexico
and Guatemala when the Spanish conquistadors arrived, but political
dominance in the area had shifted to the Aztec Empire, whose capital
city Tenochtitlan was located further north in the Valley of
Mexico. The Aztecs were conquered in 1521 by Hernán Cortés.”); and 999
Level 3 Vital Articles, including 80 on history and 99 on geography.</p>
<p>How about the killing fields of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, also
mentioned in the same note?  Among the Level 2 Vital Articles we find
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Modern_Period">Late Modern Period</a>” (19000 words, 123kB) which mentions the
Cambodian genocide, but no more; and “<a href="https://www.oercommons.org/courses/linear-algebra-4">Asia</a>” (15000 words, 104kB)
which mentions “the Cambodian Killing Fields”, but no more.  We don’t
find enough detail to understand the allusions in <a href="../notes/pandemic-collapse.html">Pandemic collapse</a> until Level 3, which sketches the history of
the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in its articles “Vietnam”, “Cold War”
(36000 words, 233kB) including multiple paragraphs and a photo of a
shelf full of skulls, “Mao Zedong”, “Theravada”, “Dictatorship”, and
especially “Genocide” (17000 words, 109kB).</p>
<p>So we can infer that probably, at least when it comes to understanding
my historical references, having read all of Wikipedia’s Level 3 Vital
Articles are probably sufficient.  This is not true for scientific
knowledge; “Temperature”, “Fire”, “Electric light”, and
“Electromagnetic radiation” mention black body radiation briefly but
do not mention the Stefan–Boltzmann law.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Level 3 Vital Articles are some 20 million words and
would blow out the 20-megabyte download budget for Derctuo, even
without any pictures.  The thought above of having about 4096 words
for every 4 million people would be more than adequate for Cambodia,
though, since in the 16384 words on Cambodia, we could surely find
space to mention the Khmer Rouge.</p>
<p>Reading Level 3 might take a year at a reasonable level of reading
speed, a bit over 1000 hours if you read it like a novel.</p>
<h2>Possible plethoras of sources</h2>
<p>Possible sources include MIT OpenCourseware, Wikipedia, Wikibooks,
cnx.org (before it shuts down), OpenStreetMap, Project Gutenberg, the
Internet Archive etexts collections, and for recent things, PLoS and
arXiv.org.  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150711143053/www.boundless.com/textbooks/">Boundless</a> used to have some open-content textbooks but
they seem to have mostly been lost, though fragments like <a href="https://hefferon.net/source.html">their
definition of limits</a> survive in part.  <a href="https://www.oercommons.org/">OERCommons</a> has a search
engine over thousands of freely licensed educational resources, of
which nearly a thousand few are <a href="https://www.oercommons.org/courses/world-civilizations-i-open-course/view">textbooks</a>, such as <a href="https://www.oercommons.org/courses/linear-algebra-4">Jim
Hefferon’s linear algebra book</a> (CC-BY-SA, 7.5MB, 507pp.).
(See also the section on “particular textbooks” below about Hefferon’s work.)
They
also link to OpenStax (which I’d forgotten about), Delft OCW, CMU OLI,
and another dozen or so similar initiatives.</p>
<p>GWU has a <a href="https://libguides.gwu.edu/opentextbooks/findingopentextbooks">guide to open textbooks</a> which links to most of the above.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major_Creative_Commons_licensed_works">list of notable CC works</a>, including Connexions
(which I guess is cnx.org), Khan Academy (cc-by-nc-sa), OpenLearn,
OCW, something called “The Saylor Foundation”, WikiEducator, 375000
CC0 artworks from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, deviantART, Flickr,
Open Game Art, Openclipart, etc.</p>
<p>Many public-domain books, including some nonfiction, are in Project
Gutenberg and Wikisource, as well as the Internet Archive’s books
collection.  <a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2020/">Everything up to 1924 is PD in the US now, including
<em>Rhapsody in Blue</em></a>.  <a href="https://1923.press/">Parker Higgins collated many striking 1923
works in a zine last year</a>, though I think <a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2019/">a more striking work
still is Kahlil Gibran’s <em>The Prophet</em></a>.  Also, perhaps, the
Russells’ <em>The Prospects of Industrial Civilization</em>.  The Hathi Trust
catalogues <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/ls?a=srchls;c=149827760;q1=*">53940 works published in 1923</a>, of which 33105 are
books.</p>
<h2>A dismal assessment of OERCommons</h2>
<p>The OERCommons textbooks mentioned earlier include 17 history
textbooks, but most are too specific to include either of the events I
was using as test points above.  <a href="https://www.oercommons.org/courses/world-civilizations-i-open-course/view">World Civilizations I</a> (CC-BY)
was the only one that seemed broad enough to mention Cambodia, but
unfortunately has been lost.  <a href="https://www.oercommons.org/courses/western-civilization-a-concise-history-volume-3?__hub_id=19">Western Civilization: A Concise
History, Volume 3</a> (CC-BY-NC, 105k words, 10MB as .odt, 274 pp.)
starts with Napoleon, too late to cover Cortés, but its <a href="https://www.oercommons.org/courses/western-civilization-a-concise-history-volume-2/view">volume 2</a>
(CC-BY-NC, 87k words, 229 pp.) does devote a few paragraphs to the
events.</p>
<h2>Particular textbooks to check out</h2>
<p><a href="https://hefferon.net/source.html">Jim Hefferon’s <em>Linear Algebra</em>, <em>Theory of Computation</em>, and
<em>Introduction to Proofs</em></a> are cc-by-sa 3.0 disjunction GFDL, with
LaTeX source.  He says the linear algebra text is “a popular text”.  I
haven’t reviewed the books yet, but some people seem to like them,
though <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24905486">others tar them as unrigorous</a>.  And they come with
exercise solutions and video lectures.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gwern.net/About#license">SICP</a> is under cc-by-sa 4.0.  I think <a href="https://tgvaughan.github.io/sicm/toc.html"><em>Structure and
Interpretation of Classical Mechanics</em></a> is under cc-nc-by-sa 4.0.
It’s using MathJax.</p>
<p><a href="https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf"><em>Mathematics for Computer Science</em></a> is a cc-by-sa 987-page PDF
covering things like graphs, satisfiability, and linear recurrences.</p>
<p>I am greatly enjoying <a href="reuleaux.html">Reuleaux</a>’s presentation of kinematics, which
is in the public domain due to its age.  However, the idea of reducing
it to files of a manageable size seems daunting.</p>
<p>I really liked MacKay’s <em>[Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air]</em>.
Disappointingly, his book on information theory is not available under
a free license, and neither is <em>Without the Hot Air</em>/<em>SEWTHA</em> as it
turns out.</p>
<p>PLOS ONE has <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/browse/systematic_reviews">a systematic reviews category</a>, but most of the 1507
reviews therein are pretty narrow: “Healthcare-associated infection
and its determinants in Ethiopia: A systematic review and
meta-analysis” and the like, although “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0238910">Fecal microbiota
transplantation in inflammatory bowel disease patients: A systematic
review and meta-analysis</a>” sounds pretty interesting.</p>
<p>On the topic of formal logic, Sean Palmer recommends <a href="http://forallx.openlogicproject.org/forallxyyc.pdf">forall x</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/wo/tpg">Tree Proof Generator</a> (usable online at
<a href="https://www.umsu.de/trees/">https://www.umsu.de/trees/</a>), and the whole Metamath website, which
is in the public domain, including things like <a href="http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/sqrt2irr.html">the proof that √2 is
irrational</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gwern.net/About#license">Gwern licensed his entire site under CC0.</a> It mostly discusses IQ,
epistemology, pharmacology, IQ, deep learning, other aspects of AI,
statistics, genetics, IQ, politics, psychology, biology, programming,
economics, and IQ, but occasionally strays from that focus.  Uses
Mathjax.  He explains his motivation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of these pages is not to be a model of concision,
  maximizing entertainment value per word, or to preach to a choir by
  elegantly repeating a conclusion.  Rather, I am attempting to
  explain things to my future self, who is intelligent and interested,
  but has forgotten.  What I am doing is explaining why I decided what
  I did to myself and noting down everything I found interesting about
  it for future reference.  I hope my other readers, whomever they may
  be, might find the topic as interesting as I found it, and the essay
  useful or at least entertaining–but the intended audience is my
  future self.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The source code of his pages (in a Pandoc-implemented language derived
from Markdown) is accessible by appending .page to the URL.  He says
the whole thing is kept in Git, but I don’t know where.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/derctuo.html">Derctuo</a> (9 notes)
