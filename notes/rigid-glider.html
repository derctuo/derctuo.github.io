(1 minute)</div><p>In <a href="cmg-walker.html">CMG Walker</a> I wrote about how to make a mobile
machine with a totally rigid and seamless surface: no joints, no
wheels, no flexion.</p>
<p>A glider or submarine of this sort could perhaps work exclusively by
moving its center of mass internally, like the OrbSwarm robots, rather
than using reaction wheels or CMGs; this is a significant part of how
hang-gliders work.  In the case of a submarine, a similar tactic can
alter its buoyancy, which can be used to propel it forward, though
this requires either a flexible surface or some transport of mass,
probably water, across the surface, for example through a hole.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/contrivances.html">Contrivances</a> (44 notes)
