(2 minutes)</div><p>Suppose we build big machines to remove CO₂ from the atmosphere to get
back down from 400 ppm back to pre-industrial levels.  If we froze all
that excess CO₂ into a big block of dry ice, how big would it be?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth">atmosphere</a> has a mass of about 5.15 × 10¹⁸ kg, and 0.414% of
that is CO₂, by volume.  The average molecular weight of dry air is
about 28.95 g/mol, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2">CO₂</a> is 44.01 g/mol, making it 1.52 times
the density of dry air.  (The CO₂ page on WP says 1.53 times.)  This
means that CO₂ is about 0.629 / (0.629 + 100 - 0.414) = 0.628% of the
atmosphere by mass, or 3.25 × 10¹⁶ kg.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change#Greenhouse_gases">Pre-industrial levels were
about 250 ppm</a>, so we only need to remove about 164 ppm, or
164/414 of the total; that's about 1.29 × 10¹⁶ kg.</p>
<p>The density of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_ice#Properties">dry ice</a> varies from 1.4–1.6 g/cc, so this would be
about 8–9 × 10¹² m³ of dry ice, roughly a cube 20 km on a side.  This
is the volume of about 50–60 trillion barrels of oil, almost a
thousand times the size of the Ghawar supergiant oil field, the
largest among the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_reservoir#Oil_field">40 000 or so oil fields in the world</a>.</p>
<p>If you pump the CO₂ back into the ground, the high pressure will
convert it to highly compressed supercritical CO₂, almost the same
density as dry ice, so this is probably a reasonable estimate of how
much underground storage space is needed.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li>Global warming</li><li>Environment</li><li>CO₂</li><li>Atmospheric carbon capture</li></ul></div></html>
