(2 minutes)</div><p>I was reading Steinmetz's 1892 paper about hysteresis, and I was
struck by the readability and elegance of the prose used by learned
societies at the time, next to which most modern academic writing
feels leaden:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The subject that we have to-night before us, and which you will find
so ably dealt with by Mr. Steinmetz, relates to that phenomenon of
molecular friction, which Mr. Ewing has denominated "hysteresis."
Mr. Ewing, as we all know, has made the subject so peculiarly his own,
that one might at first suppose there was nothing new to be known
about it; but I am confident that after this paper is read, those of
us who read it with Mr. Steinmetz will find that there is something
new under the sun. We will now hear Mr. Steinmetz's paper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was at the beginning of 1892; in 1891 he had published
"Elementary Geometric Theory of the Alternate-Current Transformer" in
<em>Electrical Engineer</em>, volume (?) 11, 1891, "627ff. on p. 627; 12
(1891): 12ff."  He <em>also</em> published things in <em>German</em> starting in
<em>1890</em>: "Das Transformatorenproblem in elementargeometrischer
Behandlungsweise", <em>ETZ</em>, 11 (1890): 185-186, 205-206, 225-227,
233-234, 345-348, and in 1891, "Anwendung des Polardiagrams der
Wechselstrom für inductive Widerstände", <em>ETZ</em>, 12 (1891): 394-396,
405-407.</p>
<p>Here, in the Q&amp;A, he tries to set that jackass Pupin straight about
some mistakes Pupin was making:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, to make the current considerable only for a
moment, while immediately before and after it is small, either the
induced E. M. F. must suddenly decrease enormously, and the next
moment increase just as suddenly --- which is impossible, because it
is the differential quotient of magnetism --- or the primary
E. M. F. had to rise and decrease again very suddenly, and such a
sudden rise, and immediately afterwards decrease of primary
impressed E. M. F., not only is an electro dynamic alternator unable
to produce, but no electric circuit would permit a current of such
enormously large value and short duration to pass.</p>
