List</a> I measured the individual
copper conductors in a stranded power cable as 100 μm, a distance
usually described as “the width of a human hair” — my beard is human,
perhaps, but apparently not my head.  I thought I’d work out a little
bit about the properties of 100-μm wiring.</p>
<p>This would be 38-gauge wire on the AWG scale, and it should be about
2.2Ω per meter.  (This may be correct, but I’m not able to measure it
with much accuracy.  My meter measures a short circuit as 0.8Ω and a
150-mm length of this wire as 2.8Ω.  At least it doesn’t say 10Ω.)
So, for circuits with diameters in the millimeters with impedances in
the kilohms, this wire is perfectly adequate for carrying voltages
around.</p>
<p>If it’s carrying 100 mA it should drop 0.22 V/m, or 0.22 mV/mm, and
dissipate 22 mW/m, or 22 μW/mm.  So you might want to use multiple
strands for your ECL chips’ V<sub>CC</sub> and GND pins, or for your
precision analog supplies.</p>
<p>So perhaps you can prototype a circuit by gluing a bunch of SMD
components to a piece of paper or wood, a millimeter or two apart,
then soldering this hair wire to their terminals, all under a
microscope.  You should only need a few micrograms of solder per
joint, and melting that solder shouldn’t require much heat.  The hair
wire doesn’t come insulated, but at centimeter scales it’s
sufficiently rigid and elastic that it won’t easily produce accidental
shorts on the workbench from vibration or other random forces;
nevertheless you might want to do some conformal coating with nail
polish or lacquer or something before sending your little circuit out
into the big, scary world.  In some cases you might even pot it.</p>
<p>A spot welder might be more appropriate equipment than a traditional
iron that relies on thermal conduction.  Thermal conduction is
necessarily fairly slow, so if you’re soldering onto a large
thermally-conductive mass, you need to heat the whole thing up, not
just the solder for the connection.  This increases the energy needed
by orders of magnitude.  Still, a regular soldering iron does work.</p>
<p>Non-surface-mount components, as well as BGAs and the like, can
perhaps be handled by dead-bugging them, gluing them with their legs
in the air.</p>
<p>Here’s a photo of three such wires soldered to three of the pins of a
through-hole SZIP, taken with my hand computer’s built-in camera,
which I used for the soldering as well:</p>
