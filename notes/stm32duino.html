<p>But I thought maybe this might be outdated and maybe it's better to
use ST's official package.  Boy, was I ever fucking wrong.  It's a
fucking trojan horse.</p>

<p>This installs, by default, version 1.9.0, which occupies tens of megs,
takes fucking forever, and then gives an error about
STM32CubeProgrammer.  What the fuck is STM32CubeProgrammer?</p>

<p>Okay, fuck, I guess I have another fucking hoop to jump through.
What's this STM32CubeProgrammer thing?  Some kind of open-source
firmware uploader?</p>
<p>No, that couldn't be more
wrong. <a href="https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html">https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html</a> is

<p>Regardless of whether you'd have any ethical reason to obey this, or
whether it could actually be enforced in court or not, I have a CKS32,
not an STM32, and the above is a crystal-clear threat from ST: buy our
hardware or else.  Ew ew ew ew ew.</p>
<p>I'm installing version 1.5.0 now, which is still literally 82 fucking
megabytes.  And still takes fucking forever.  Like on the order of
half a fucking hour.</p>
<p>This done, "STLink" appears as an option for "Upload method" under the
Arduino 1.8.14 "Tools" menu.  However, the "Port" submenu is grayed
out, and evidently it can't find the "STLink".  On replugging it, I
see in <code>dmesg</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[802528.168367] usb 2-1: USB disconnect, device number 6

<p>And I have a new file in /dev/char:</p>
<pre><code>lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   18 Nov  6 19:54 189:134 -&gt; ../bus/usb/002/007
</code></pre>
<p>I can read some data from it, so it's probably not a permissions
problem:</p>
<pre><code>$ &lt; /dev/char/189:134 xxd

</code></pre>
<p>What that means is anybody's guess.  The device disappears if I unplug
the "STLink".</p>
<p>In theory, according to
<a href="https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/wiki/Programming-an-STM32F103XXX-with-a-generic-%22ST-Link-V2%22-programmer-from-Linux">https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/wiki/Programming-an-STM32F103XXX-with-a-generic-%22ST-Link-V2%22-programmer-from-Linux</a>,

<p>That's wonderful!  That's precisely the error I've seen other people
report with the CKS32 devices.  So I made the relevant config change:</p>
<pre><code>$ diff -u /usr/share/openocd/scripts/target/stm32f1x.cfg ~/devel/dev3/cks32f1x.cfg

<p>And then OpenOCD apparently works; anyway it doesn't crash immediately

<p>So OpenOCD is successfully connecting!  But I'm still some distance
away from burning the "blink" sketch onto the hardware.</p>
<p>The access-denied problem that led me to try running it with sudo
straces as follows:</p>
<pre><code>open("/dev/bus/usb/002/008", O_RDWR)    = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
write(2, "Error: libusb_open() failed with"..., 53Error: libusb_open() failed with LIBUSB_ERROR_ACCESS
</code></pre>
<p>And indeed I don't have permission to write to that device, only read:</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -l /dev/bus/usb/002/008
crw-rw-r-- 1 root plugdev 189, 135 Nov  6 20:49 /dev/bus/usb/002/008
</code></pre>
<p>However, I <em>am</em> in /etc/group as belonging to plugdev, I guess I just
haven't logged out and back in since then.  So I launch the arduino
IDE in the plugdev group:</p>
<pre><code>arduno-nightly$ sg plugdev ./arduino
</code></pre>
<p>However, that doesn't help; the "Port" submenu of "Tools" is still
grayed out.  And <code>sudo ./arduino</code> of course doesn't have the STM32
board package installed.  I copied everything in my ~/.arduino15 to
root's, and then the board package is installed, but it has the same
problem.  I tried <code>chmod 666 /dev/bus/usb/002/008</code>, and then OpenOCD
works without <code>sudo</code>, but the Arduino IDE still has a greyed-out
"Port" menu.</p>
<p>Next steps, I guess, are to try Arduino with the Dan Drown stm32duino
stuff (or maybe <a href="https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/wiki/Installation">rogerclarkemelbourne's zip
file</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/archive/master.zip">actual
file</a>)?);
or to try to program it with OpenOCD; or to use OpenOCD to install
some kind of USB bootloader on it.</p>
<p>But I think that's about all for tonight; I've been trying things on
and off for 9 hours.  I'll see what I can manage tomorrow.  The fact
that now OpenOCD works means that success is in sight.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (42 notes)
