(3 minutes)</div><p>Slide rules can’t add and subtract.  Could they?</p>
<p>If <em>a</em> ≠ 0, then <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> = (1 + <em>b</em>/<em>a</em>)<em>a</em>.  Suppose our slide rule
reads with a precision of ±0.2%; then if <em>b</em>/<em>a</em> &lt; 0.002, we can just
round this to <em>a</em>, and if <em>b</em>/<em>a</em> &gt; 500, we can just round it to <em>b</em>.
But in between, when they’re of roughly similar magnitudes, we might
want to use this to calculate a decent approximation of the sum.</p>
<p>In Logarithm Land, we have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>log(<em>a</em> + <em>b</em>) = log(1 + 10<sup>log <em>b</em> - log <em>a</em></sup>) + log(<em>a</em>), <em>a</em> ≠ 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can add the ability to evaluate this to a slide rule as follows.
Define <em>j</em>(<em>c</em>) = log(1 + 10<sup><em>c</em></sup>).  Add three <em>j</em> scales to
the body of the slide rule: one with marks at log(1 +
10<sup><em>c</em></sup>) for 1 ≤ <em>c</em> ≤ 10, one with marks for 10 ≤ <em>c</em> ≤ 100,
and one with marks for 100 ≤ <em>c</em> ≤ 1000.</p>
<p>To add two numbers of the same sign, then, take the larger one as <em>b</em>.
Use the C and D scales to compute log <em>b</em> - log <em>a</em> as a position on
the D scale; move the cursor to it.  Look on the appropriate <em>j</em> scale
to read the numerical value of (1 + <em>b</em>/<em>a</em>).  Now use the C and D
scales to multiply that numerical value by <em>a</em>, which perhaps you
still have encoded in the position of the slide.</p>
<p>Working backwards from there, we want the slide to be in a position
that encodes multiplying by <em>a</em>, which means that the D-scale index
should be aligned with <em>a</em> on the C scale.  This means that <em>b</em> needed
to be on C originally.</p>
<p>So the procedure is: choose <em>b</em> to be the larger of the two summands,
exchanging them if necessary.  Align the slide to <em>a</em> on the C scale.
Move the cursor to <em>b</em> on the C scale; its position on the body is now
log <em>b</em> - log <em>a</em>, so the cursor on the D scale now indicates <em>b</em>/<em>a</em>.
Look up the numerical value of 1 - <em>b</em>/<em>a</em> on the appropriate <em>j</em>
scale with the cursor.  Move the cursor to that numerical value on the
D scale.  Now read <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> on the C scale with the cursor.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if there’s a similarly convenient approach using the CI
and DI scales, or if there’s a way to use that same <em>j</em> scale for
subtraction, or if it works better to use <em>b</em> &lt; <em>a</em> (could that give
you fewer <em>j</em> scales?).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~alfeld/sliderules/">Peter Alfeld reports that Jeff Weiner
reports</a> that the
Pickett Microline 115 and the Pickett 901 rules <em>can</em> add and
subtract, but it turns out that those just have linearly-ruled X and Y
scales; they can’t add and subtract numbers found on the standard
scales like C, D, A, and B, nor do their sums and differences appear
there.</p>
<p>Now, of course this is not very useful if your precision is ±0.2%: you
only have three sig figs, and adding two three-digit numbers in your
head isn’t that hard.  You could imagine a higher-precision slide rule
using verniers, finer details, and/or larger dimensions, perhaps
folded helically.  This approach might then be more useful.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/contrivances.html">Contrivances</a> (44 notes)
