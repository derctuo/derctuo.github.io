(15 minutes)</div><p>The humans like to memorialize dates by holding annual celebrations.
What kinds of dates would a hacker culture memorialize?</p>
<p>I’m putting together a date table here in a sort of cuckoo-hash
fashion: most dates commemorate individual hackers, and for most of
the hackers the relevant known dates are their birthdate and their
death date.  When there is a collision, I can usually move the person
in question to a different relevant date: their death date if they’re
listed at their birthdate, or vice versa.</p>
<p>So, for example, to insert Laplace, Hao Wang moved from May 20 to May
13, allowing Jean Sammet to move from March 23 to May 20, freeing up
March 23 for Laplace.  Laplace’s death date, March 5, was occupied by
William Oughtred, who died June 30, which is already quite full with
two difficult-to-move events: the feast of Ramon Llull and the release
of OpenGL.</p>
