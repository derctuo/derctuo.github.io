<p>I’ve written a little bit previously about a sort of pattern-matching
Prolog, where instead of dealing with explicitly given relations:</p>
<pre><code>father(fred, mary).
parent(X, Y) :- father(X, Y).
parent(X, Y) :- mother(X, Y).
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), ancestor(Z, Y).
</code></pre>
<p>you deal with strings of text, such as lines in a CSV file or a chat
transcript, or sentences:</p>
<pre><code>Fred is Mary's father
Mary is John's mother

'Foo' is 'Bar''s father
----
Foo is Bar's parent

'Foo' is 'Bar''s mother
----
Foo is Bar's parent

'Alice' is 'Bill''s parent
----
Alice is Bill's ancestor

'Alice' is 'Carol''s parent
Carol is 'Bill''s ancestor
----
Alice is Bill's ancestor
</code></pre>
<p>From this we can deduce:</p>
<pre><code>Fred is Mary's parent
Fred is Mary's ancestor
Mary is John's parent
Mary is John's ancestor
Fred is John's ancestor
</code></pre>
<p>In Prolog-style top-down search, this is kind of tricky, since you
kind of have to guess which inference rules can match which patterns,
but in Datalog bottom-up inference, there’s no difficulty; each newly
inferred sentence need only be matched against the premises of all the
rules to see if it enables additional sentences to be inferred.  This
won’t be nearly as efficient as Prolog, but that’s fine.  It’s
probably efficient enough for many uses just by brute force, and a
little indexing on infrequent words should go the rest of the way.</p>
<p>I was thinking about this last night and got really excited.  I think
it might offer an easily usable system with enough expressive power to
be useful.</p>
<h2>Basic UI</h2>
<p>Interactively or in batch mode, a UI for such a database can add a
table of results underneath each set of premises, which are
distinguished from ground facts by containing variables.  (Above I’ve
marked these with apostrophes, but other syntax might be better,
especially for natural languages containing contractions.)  In batch
mode, it could simply process a text file and produce a file annotated
with deductions and query results.</p>
<h2>Negation</h2>
<p>But you can also add negation, using the standard Datalog
stratification approach (done dynamically rather than statically):</p>
<pre><code>'Aaron' is indicted
\+ Aaron is guilty
----
Aaron is falsely accused
</code></pre>
<p>I’m not totally clear on how this works without doing the kind of
textual rule analysis that I said above was difficult.</p>
<p>I think this approach might work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Initially, put all the purely monotonic rules in stratum 0, and all
  the nonmonotonic ones in stratum 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do inferences stratum by stratum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain a list of inferred assertions for each rule, and of course
  the derivation for each inferred fact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a newly inferred fact Ⅰ requires the retraction of some
  previously inferred fact Ⅱ, that means that Ⅱ was inferred too
  early.  So we retract all the assertions inferred from the rule by
  which Ⅱ was inferred — call it R(Ⅱ); add an
  inequality constraint putting it in a <em>strictly greater</em> stratum
  than R(Ⅰ), calling Ⅰ’s rule’s stratum S(R(Ⅰ)): “S(R(Ⅱ)) &gt; S(R(Ⅰ))”;
  and move it to the stratum after R(Ⅰ).
  We also need to retract all assertions from other rules that are
  constrained to be in S(R(Ⅱ)) or later and move them as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a newly inferred fact Ⅰ permits the inference of another newly
  inferred fact Ⅱ, that means that the rule R(Ⅱ) by which Ⅱ was
  inferred should be at a stratum greater than <em>or equal to</em> the
  stratum of the rule R(Ⅰ) by which Ⅰ was inferred.  So we add an
  inequality S(R(Ⅱ)) ≥ S(R(Ⅰ)) to a topological sorting database on
  that basis, if it is not already there.  This may involve moving
  R(Ⅱ) to the current stratum, may involve moving other rules
  constrained to be in a greater than or equal stratum to the current
  stratum, and may require moving other rules to higher strata.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retraction chaining from retraction to either assertion or
  retraction is handled by the shotgun approach of retracting
  everything from a rule that is being promoted to a stratum after the
  current one, because any rule that transitively depended on a rule
  being thus promoted will also be promoted and thus all its
  assertions also retracted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon encountering circular dependencies with a negation in the
  chain, throw up hands and report them to the user.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This clearly isn’t the most efficient mechanism, since we may waste
substantial work on a chain of reasoning that must be later retracted
when it was discovered to depend on a rule that was applied too early,
but I think it might be adequately efficient in practice.</p>
<h2>Aggregate formulas</h2>
<p>Also you can add aggregate functions:</p>
<pre><code>'X' has line item 'Y'
'Y' costs 'Z'
----
X totals =total(Z)
</code></pre>
<p>where implicitly we are quantifying over all Y (or, I guess, reducing
over all Y) because Y does not occur in the rule’s conclusion outside
of an aggregate.</p>
<p>Aggregates include =count(), =sum(), =total(), =mean(), =stdev(), =max(),
=min(), =product(), =list() (which separates items with commas) and =any(), which
just picks one of the values in some unspecified way.</p>
<p>=argmax() and =argmin() are aggregates taking <em>two</em> arguments: the
first is the thing to be returned, while the second is the thing to be
maximized or minimized.  So, for example, to get the material that
provides the lowest cost, you say =argmin(material, cost).</p>
<p>This kind of aggregation involves a form of negation similar to the
above.  Suppose you want to count the children of each node in a tree:</p>
<pre><code>'Child' is a child of 'parent'
---
Parent has =count(child) children
</code></pre>
<p>We may at some point have deduced that X has 3 children, and then
later infer a fourth child of X.  The result involves not only adding
“X has 4 children” to the database of known facts, but also
<em>retracting</em> “X has 3 children”.  So something like stratification is
necessary to provide the aggregation feature, at least without a lot
of wasted work, possible nondeterminism (where the result depends on
what order the rules were applied in), and possible nontermination.
(See the section below about dynamical systems, though, for other
sources of nontermination.)</p>
<h2>Scalar formulas</h2>
<p>And of course you can have other formulas as well:</p>
<pre><code>'C' is a cylinder
C has radius 'r'
C has height 'h'
---
C has volume =(pi r² h)
C has surface area =(2 pi r² + 2 pi r h)

'Something' is made of 'unobtainium'
Unobtainium has density 'D'
Something has volume 'v'
----
Something has mass =(D*v)
</code></pre>
<p>Here because <code>D</code> and <code>v</code> occur outside of an aggregate function you
are not aggregating over all the densities and volumes.  If it happens
that some object has two volumes and is made of two materials, each of
which have two densities, then the system will deduce eight masses for
it.</p>
<h2>Abbreviation</h2>
<p>It’s probably better to abbreviate this:</p>
<pre><code>'C':
    is a cylinder
    has:
        radius 'r'
        height 'h'
---
C has:
    volume =(pi r² h)
    surface area =(2 pi r² + 2 pi r h)

'It':
    is made of 'unobtainium'
    has volume 'v'
Unobtainium has density 'D'
----
It has mass =(D*v)
</code></pre>
<h2>Goal seek</h2>
<p>In this form the system is sort of unidirectional; it can infer the
volume of a cylinder from its radius and height, but it can’t infer
its radius from its volume and height.  Spreadsheets use a special
“goal seek” interaction for this; you identify which cells are “design
variables” the optimizer can twiddle and which cell you want to give a
given value, and it twiddles the design variables to approximate it as
closely as possible.  This could be supported syntactically, using the
same syntactic distinction between variables and constants as in
premises:</p>
<pre><code>c1:
    is a cylinder
    has height 32cm
*seek*:
    c1 has:
        volume 1 m³
        radius 'r'
</code></pre>
<p>This doesn’t give you the whole bidirectional power of constraint
solvers, but it’s very simple to use and implement, and perfectly
adequate for many computations I do in Derctuo.</p>
<h2>Libraries</h2>
<p>You probably want to be able to import library modules so that you
don’t have to explain things like cylinders and densities in every
database.  Probably the best way to do this, in a textual system, is
to stick a line in the file saying something like</p>
<pre><code>:use circuits geometry shapes
</code></pre>
<p>But this should probably be at the end of the file.</p>
<h2>Existentials</h2>
<p>If you say that some object is a cylinder, you probably don’t want the
system to posit a material from which it is made.  But there might be
cases where you do want such deductions:</p>
<pre><code>'x' is a car
----
'something' is the steering wheel of x
</code></pre>
<p>Here we have a free variable in the conclusion of the rule, with the
meaning that the system is entitled to make up an object to fill that
role if nothing else turns up.  This involves a sort of negation.</p>
<h2>Quantities</h2>
<p>Above I’ve talked about quantities like <code>32cm</code> and <code>1 m³</code>, which have
units and are expressed in Unicode notation.  This is very valuable
for a lot of the calculations I’m doing.  I’m not sure if you can
implement that within the system or what.</p>
<p>You know what else would be very valuable?  Intervals.  <code>32cm±5cm</code>.
<code>1–1.5m³</code>.  And gradients: when a value is computed by a formula from
some given data, it would be useful to see what its gradient is in
terms of those givens.  Computing the gradient is of course also very
useful for “goal seek”.</p>
<h2>UI affordances</h2>
<p>Tabular output can go beyond the simple column-per-variable default;
you can, for example, specify a sort key, change the order of columns,
change the formatting of columns, pivot one or more variables to be
the column headers for the others, hide columns, etc.  In an
interactive system, you could add rows to the table as a form of data
entry.</p>
<p>A non-interactive system can be implemented that just reads in a text
file and spews out an augmented version of it.</p>
<p>It’s probably useful to see all the inferred facts, as well as which
given facts and rules were used to infer each inferred fact.  In rules
with a single conclusion, there’s a one-to-one correpondence between
table rows (<em>pace</em> pivoting) and inferred facts, but if there are
multiple conclusions there may be more than one.</p>
<p>Filtering this list of inferences down to a usable list might be a
challenge.  Interactively, too, we might want to know why a given
conclusion was <em>not</em> reached from a given rule: which of the premises
failed to hold true?  This kind of “why <em>not</em>” debugging is usually
easy in functional programs but very difficult in imperative programs;
it seems like it would be pretty difficult to incorporate
non-interactively in a “program listing”, but you could supply it as a
separate batch-mode command similar to goal-seek.</p>
<h2>Multiple words and nesting</h2>
<p>All of the above is entirely without nesting, and the lack of nesting
is one of the great UI benefits of logic programming in general.  But
sometimes you do need nesting in order to be able to correctly reason
about complicated propositions, especially without existentials.</p>
<p>A really simple approach, which doesn’t go far, is to allow variables
to match arbitrary sequences of words instead of single words:</p>
<pre><code>Bob Smith is a person
Mary Smith is a person

'Someone' is a person
----
Someone has skin

'John' 'Doe' is a person
'Richard' Doe is a person
---
John Doe is related to Richard Doe
</code></pre>
<p>From this we can infer, among other things, that Mary Smith has skin
and Mary Smith is related to Bob Smith.</p>
<p>The simplest possible approach to nesting would be <em>not</em> allowing
variables to match arbitrary sequences of words <em>containing unmatched
parentheses</em>.  That way you could use parentheses to supply arbitrary
nesting structure.</p>
<p>It might be desirable for a variable to <em>not</em> match multiple words by
default.  This is partly a usability question that ought to be studied
by studying users.</p>
<h3>Regexps</h3>
<p>If you’re trying to apply this kind of tool to parsing text that it
wasn’t intended for, it might be convenient to specify a regex to
constrain the matches.</p>
<pre><code>start 'year/\d+/'-'month/\d+/'-'day/\d+/'
---
Session began 'day'.'month'.'year'
</code></pre>
<h2>Denesting</h2>
<p>The abbreviation facility above suggests writing:</p>
<pre><code>I should buy:
    red peppers
    bananas
    apples
</code></pre>
<p>to create three facts.  But what if we’re trying to assimilate
something like</p>
<pre><code>I should buy red peppers, bananas, apples
</code></pre>
<p>Then maybe it would be useful to be able to write a rule with a
premise like</p>
<pre><code>I should buy 'food...'
</code></pre>
<p>to match three times food=red peppers, food=bananas, food=apples,
vaguely similar to Scheme <code>syntax-rules</code>.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>Especially for a textual system, syntax is important for UI.  Some
alternatives to the strawman syntax above:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alternative syntax for variables.  Above I’ve only stuck sigils on
  variables to indicate their variable nature the first time they
  occur, but it might be worthwhile to use the sigil every time for
  readability; Tcl and bash seem to suffer in usability compared to
  PHP and Perl’s more universal sigil usage.  Here are some possible
  alternatives:</p>
<pre><code>'It' is made of 'unobtainium'   # example above
«It» is made of «unobtainium»   # much harder to type but safer
&lt;It&gt; is made of &lt;unobtainium&gt;   # common metavariable syntax in grammars
`It` is made of `unobtainium`   # e.g., SQL
"It" is made of "unobtainium"   # also SQL but less weird; harder to
                                # type than '' but safer with contractions
It is made of Unobtainium       # Alain Colmerauer's Prolog, without punctuation
IT is made of UNOBTAINIUM       # variant
it IS MADE OF unobtainium       # variant, often used informally for, e.g., SQL
it Is Made Of unobtainium.      # Darius Bacon's Pythological
It$ is made of unobtainium$     # BASIC
$It is made of $unobtainium     # Perl/PHP, taken from BASIC and sh; also Tcl
@It is made of @unobtainium     # Perl variant
.It is made of .unobtainium     # minimal line noise variant
:It is made of :unobtainium     # Logo/Smalltalk/Ruby(?) params, almost as calm
It :is :made :of unobtainium    # Lisp/Ruby keywords/symbols
It 'is 'made 'of unobtainium    # Lisp quoted symbols
,It is made of ,unobtainium     # Lisp quasiquoted
?It is made of ?unobtainium     # Lisp-family logic languages; N3
It? is made of unobtainium?     # variant
¿It? is made of ¿unobtainium?   # Spanish variant
{It} is made of {unobtainium}   # various templating languages
                                # including Python .format and f''
#{It} is made of #{unobtainium} # Ruby's equivalent
[It] is made of [unobtainium]   # easier to type on standard keyboard than {}
(It) is made of (unobtainium)   # the remaining ASCII nesting delimiters
%It% is made of %unobtainium%   # MS-DOS batch
%It is made of %unobtainium     # variant
¤It is made of ¤unobtainium     # variant
|It| is made of |unobtainium|   # more little-used delimiters
It* is made of unobtainium*     # asterisk connotes reference
It† is made of unobtainium†     # though daggers connote it HARDER
It... is made of unobtainium... # ellipses connote indefiniteness
It_ is made of unobtainium_     # Mathematica
</code></pre>
<p>In a multi-font system, we could imagine writing <i>It</i> is made
of <i>unobtainium</i>, <u>It</u> is made of <u>unobtainium</u>,
<b>It</b> is made of <b>unobtainium</b>, or
<span style="color: #666">It</span> is made of
<span style="color: #666">unobtainium</span> instead.
   (Note that if you’re viewing
this on GitLab some of the formatting in this paragraph gets
mangled by their buggy Markdown parser.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative syntax for deduction.  The line of dashes echoes the
  sequent calculus but it’s kind of heavyweight, and how many dashes
  do you use, anyway?  Does it matter?  And then there’s the question
  of how far its scope extends (above, to the first blank line).  And
  should the premises come before the conclusion, as above, or after
  it?  Here is the original and some strawman alternatives:</p>
<pre><code>    {Alice} is {Carol}'s parent
    {Carol} is {Bill}'s ancestor
    ----
    {Alice} is {Bill}'s ancestor

    {Alice} is {Bill}'s ancestor :-
        {Alice} is {Carol}'s parent
        {Carol} is {Bill}'s ancestor

    {Alice} is {Bill}'s ancestor?
        {Alice} is {Carol}'s parent
        {Carol} is {Bill}'s ancestor

    if:
        {Alice} is {Carol}'s parent
        {Carol} is {Bill}'s ancestor
    then:
        {Alice} is {Bill}'s ancestor

    {A} is {C}'s parent; {C} is {B}'s ancestor |- {A} is {B}'s ancestor

    :A is :C's parent; :C is :B's ancestor { :A is :B's ancestor }

    {Alice} is {Carol}'s parent
    {Carol} is {Bill}'s ancestor
    :. {Alice} is {Bill}'s ancestor

    {Alice} is {Carol}'s parent
    {Carol} is {Bill}'s ancestor
    =&gt; {Alice} is {Bill}'s ancestor
</code></pre>
<p>Although I like the one with “:.”, the closest ASCII equivalent of
“∴”, I think the last one with “=&gt;”, due to deltab, is better.
They both avoid spurious visual suggestions of nesting, it’s
compact, and there’s only one way to do (each of) them.  The
<code>premises { conclusion }</code> idea, also due to deltab, is also very
nice, but like the turnstile <code>|-</code> it clashes somewhat with the
overall line-oriented style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative syntax for formulas.  I think most formulas will
  probably be fairly simple affairs, so it’s nice to be able to
  introduce them with just a single character instead of nested
  delimiters; <code>=total(cost)</code> beats <code>[total(cost)]</code> on visual noise.
  And the <code>=</code> syntax is familiar from Excel, having replaced
  Visicalc’s <code>@</code> syntax (also used in Lotus 1-2-3, though with one
  less period for ranges): <code>+B1-SUM(C2...C8)</code>.  Still, you could
  imagine other syntaxes.  ES5 template strings use <code>${2 * a + b}</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Queries and reporting</h2>
<p>Every set of premises is a query whose answer is a table, but it might
be more useful to be able to include only some of these tables in a
formatted output report.</p>
<h2>Inequalities</h2>
<p>For a lot of calculations I care a lot about inequalities: the weight
is less than the weight capacity, the temperature is less than the
melting point, the change in Gibbs free energy is negative, the
absolute pressure is positive, and so on.  It seems like the best way
to incorporate these inequalities into rules is simply as a special
sort of premise that is handled specially; rather than being matched
against known or inferred facts, it is checked once the relevant
variables are instantiated:</p>
<pre><code>{The body} is:
    made of {stuff}
    at atmospheric pressure
{Stuff} has:
    melting point {M}
    boiling point {B}
=&gt; {The body} is liquid from {M} to {B}

{The body}:
    is liquid from {M} to {B}
    has temperature {T}
{M} &lt; {T} &lt; {B}
=&gt; {The body} is liquid

{The body}:
    is liquid from {M} to {_}
    has temperature {T}
{T} &lt; {M}
=&gt; {The body} is solid

{The body}:
    is liquid from {_} to {B}
    has temperature {T}
{T} &gt; {B}
=&gt; {The body} is gaseous

{The body}:
    is liquid from {M} to {_}
    is slushy
=&gt; {The body} has temperature {M}
</code></pre>
<p>For point-valued scalar real quantities, these inequalities are
trichotomous: either {T} &lt; {M}, {T} == {M}, or {T} &gt; {M}.  But for
interval-valued quantities, this may not be the case; if the
temperature of some water is known to be between -4° and +4°, we
cannot conclude either that it is liquid or solid.  (Or gaseous, of
course; a more powerful modal reasoning system than what I’m proposing
could demonstrate that it is not gaseous, and that if the temperature
is &gt;0°, it is liquid.)</p>
<p>Equalities can not only be <em>checked</em> in this way, but if we permit
formulas in premises, they can also <em>instantiate variables</em>, which is
potentially useful as a way of factoring out formulas.  However, this
also has potentially complex interactions with interval-valued
variables, since knowing that two masses are both in the range (100 g,
200 g) does not demonstrate that they are equal.  (And of course this
already pops up with the equality testing implicit in multiple
occurrences.)</p>
<h2>Frames and modal reasoning</h2>
<p>All of the above puts both rules and facts in a sort of global tuple
space or string space.  But the system is clearly capable of
expressing logical consequences: if the temperature is 329°, then the
wax is liquid.  We could imagine “creating a frame” that contains some
additional facts (and perhaps omits others), and looking to see what
can be newly inferred from those facts.</p>
<p>If you have some way to export computed values from these frames, this
very quickly gives you something like Bicicleta, only with logic
programming rather than functional formulas.</p>
<h2>Arrays and dynamical systems</h2>
<p>Computers are great at iteration.  You can integrate a system of
ordinary differential equations with Euler’s method in Python in a
minute or two of programming, using a fraction of a second of CPU
time:</p>
<pre><code>$ time python
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; x0, y0 = 100, 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; x, y = x0, y0
&gt;&gt;&gt; for t in range(1000):
...   x, y = x + .01 * y - .01 * x,  y - .02 *x - .01 * y
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; x, y
(-0.0006995268370926552, -0.006688316539762943)

real    1m11.032s
user    0m0.072s
sys     0m0.056s
</code></pre>
<p>Systems like Modelica include robust numerical ODE solvers using much
more efficient, higher-precision methods.</p>
<p>But even without getting into dynamical systems, iteration is pretty
useful.  It turns out that the system as described above can handle
this example with no problem:</p>
<pre><code>At time {t} of {n} we are at ({x}, {y})
{t} &lt; {n}
=&gt; At time =({t} + 1) of {n} we are at (=({x} + .01 * {y} - .01 * {x}), =({y} - .02 * {x} - .01 * {y}))

At time {n} of {n} we are at ({x}, {y})
=&gt; Our final position is ({x}, {y})

At time 0 of 1000 we are at (100, 0)
</code></pre>
<p>Given how easy this is, it might be worthwhile to have an implicit
loop limit you can override to avoid accidental looping.  Like, in a
sense this is just transitive closure, right?</p>
<p>This kind of explicit indexing can be used for things that aren’t
iterative, too, but rather data-parallel:</p>
<pre><code>{It} emits {x} watts per square meter per nm in band {λ}
The CIE photopic perceptual weight of band {λ} is {w}
=&gt; {It} emits =mean({x} * {w}) lumens
</code></pre>
<p>This is easy to distinguish from the dangerous case above because the
derivation chain doesn’t go through the same rule over and over again.
However, I’m not entirely sure how to tell the difference between the
(safe) transitive closure of a finite relation produced in some other
way, and the (unsafe) looping case above.  So it isn’t obvious how to
implement something like Turner’s Total Functional Programming.</p>
<p>There’s a practical concern for how to get these arrays of data into
the system as a large set of assertions like the example above in the
first place.  But the solution for that doesn’t have to be elegant; it
just has to be practical.</p>
<p>Consider this Numerical Python example, where I wanted to see the
number of RC time constants needed to decay past a number of candidate
thresholds:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [round(i, 2) for i in -log((arange(99)+1)/100.0)]
[4.61, 3.91, 3.51, 3.22, 3.0, 2.81, 2.66, 2.53, 2.41, 2.3, 2.21,
2.12, 2.04, 1.97, 1.9, 1.83, 1.77, 1.71, 1.66, 1.61, 1.56, 1.51,
1.47, 1.43, 1.39, 1.35, 1.31, 1.27, 1.24, 1.2, 1.17, 1.14, 1.11,
1.08, 1.05, 1.02, 0.99, 0.97, 0.94, 0.92, 0.89, 0.87, 0.84, 0.82,

<p>This is awkward to do in Numpy because Numpy doesn’t have output
format control, so I had to resort to a regular Python list
comprehension.</p>
<p>The Scheme <code>syntax-rules</code> macro system includes an interesting “...”
construct, permitting you to rewrite, for example (foo (as a...) (bs
b...)) to (bar (b a)...), without providing full list-processing
capabilities.  That example would rewrite (foo (as 1 2 3) (bs x y z))
to (bar (x 1) (y 2) (z 3)), for example.  You could imagine supporting
a similar but more limited “...” construct in patterns in order to
be able to input array data more easily.</p>
<h2>Fuck RDF N3 syntax, seriously</h2>
<p>Consider this <a href="https://github.com/josd/eye/blob/master/reasoning/socrates/socrates.n3">example from EYE</a>, in RDF N3:</p>
<pre><code>@prefix log: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log#&gt;.
@prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;.
@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt;.
@prefix : &lt;http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/socrates#&gt;.

:Socrates a :Man.
:Man rdfs:subClassOf :Mortal.

{?A rdfs:subClassOf ?B. ?S a ?A} =&gt; {?S a ?B}.
</code></pre>
<p>This looks like a bunch of fucking line noise.  I think it’s
dramatically more understandable to express it as follows; the result,
“Socrates is a mortal”, is even more understandable than the <a href="https://github.com/josd/eye/blob/master/reasoning/socrates/socrates_proof.n3">over a
page of line noise generated by EYE</a>.</p>
<pre><code>Socrates is a man
Every man is a mortal

Every {X} is {Y}
{Z} is a {X}
=&gt; {Z} is {Y}
</code></pre>
<p>Also, the <em>input</em> is not only more readable, but also 85 characters
instead of 317 characters, almost four times smaller.</p>
<p>(The more flexible syntax might be not only more readable, but also
permit subtle bugs.  Suppose the template above had said <code>Every {X} is
{Y}.</code>, with a period at the end; then it would unintentionally fail to
match.)</p>
<p>N3 is, of course, capable of expressing enormously more powerful forms
of inference than that, including anonymous entities and so on.  But I
don’t think that’s an excuse for it to read like line noise.</p>
